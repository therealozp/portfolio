title: LinkedIn and the death of humility

description: Whatever happened to LinkedIn?
---

As a disclaimer, I have nothing against LinkedIn as a platform. I personally think LinkedIn does its job very well: it serves as a platform for people to show off something cool they have done, a milestone in their professional development, maybe re-discovering that fleeting connection with a teammate at some hackathon. And that's great! In the information era, visibility is everything. Anecdotally or not, I have heard plenty of success stories of successful offers, meaningful connections that eventually turn into friendships, the whole nine yards. There’s no denying it: the platform works - but you don’t need me to tell you that.

What I’ve started to notice, though, is a quiet shift away from those original intentions. Instead of celebrating new feats or sharing something genuinely cool, more posts now feel like exercises in self-promotion. There are the one-liner hooks, to the likes of _“If you’re not jumping on the X train, you’re falling behind,”_ or _“How I got 30 offers by doing X as a Y”_. Then comes a cascade of short, punchy lines, designed for maximum retention. Then come the challenge-bait posts: thinly veiled asks framed as bravado: _"I have never failed at X. Prove me wrong if you can.”_

I get it. In this day and age where the crowd keeps getting bigger, standing out requires creativity. In some ways more than one, this is doing just that! But, looking at the direction the platform is trending at right now, one big question looms over: **what is all of this doing to our own sense of humility?**

## the fragility of personal branding

The saying dates back to the birth of the web: if something is put on the Internet, it stays there forever. For some casual social media websites such as Facebook or Instagram, this wouldn't pose much of an issue because of its relative low-pressure environments. However, when something as important as your career is on the line, the pressure of maintaining a facade is inevitable. We always need to have our show masks on, ready to rattle away at our achievements like the ABCs. On LinkedIn (and, admittedly, many other social media platforms), the world is perfect: everyone excels at what they do, and the Earth keeps spinning. But the world isn't perfect - and that is exactly the point: we have reached this impasse where vulnerability is recognized as failure, and one dent wreaks havoc to the brand we have spent years building up.

On the one hand, I can attest to the power of personal branding. There is truly no better way of getting your name out there, especially with the reach you are able to get with modern social media. However, at some point, this system has been hijacked. This is a terrible example, but take a look at Zuckerberg's first "phenomenon" that crashed the Harvard servers. He got that traction because did something weird, unusual, but ultimately, substantial. That was the kind of "branding" that people became known for. (Again, I do **not** condone his actions, it is terrible indeed, but notoriety sticks.)

However, such events are scarce to come by. And in some ways, it is exactly this scarcity that made it so special, i.e. "branding". This changes with LinkedIn. The only thing separating you and public recognition are mere words - words that you, yourself, can conjure up! With the scale, this process becomes all too easy to game. I have oft seen too many people embellishing their achievements to the point of aggrandizement, misleading hooks that points to AI-written gibberish, or emoji-studded "advice" that just gets regurgitated over and over. Hacking the algorithm has become the main objective, and in this course, it kicks off a chain reaction that would irreversibly change the platform.

## the competition for statistics

This pressure will induce both healthy signals (in the form of inspiration), and unhealthy tendencies: jealousy, or self-deprecation. In my experience, when I see someone building a [vertex shader that runs Minecraft in a terminal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zfXM-6yPJQ), or a [fluid simulation pendant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jis1MC5Tm8k), I get inspired to build some cool stuff as well. I think that this inspiration is an absolute necessity, as I am sure many of you will feel the same. The impetus behind this inspiration is that most of these explorations take you with them, through failure after failure, and forces you to **learn**.

LinkedIn posts cut out everything that inspires. Looking at the most viral (or most reacted-with) posts on LinkedIn, it's all about metrics. This many offers, this much ARR, this many users, everything in between. You can probably discern LinkedIn-speak when you see it. I think there is a substantive reason for this, which is because that is just how we are designed: we want to see immediate value before deciding if reading this post is worthwhile. This "judging" mechanism is what fuels the LinkedIn algorithm, and because of that, it becomes more prominent.

The issue is not about posts that belong to the above archetype, the issue is when it gets **brought up so often**, it's practically on payroll. Every post has to have some mention about impressive achievement X or shock factor Y. Worse, there is no educational value out of any of this. It just becomes a place where we measure our worth against digital highlight reel. We become incentivized to come up with shock value like this, and become chained to validation. The likes, the comments, the "Congrats!" notifications - all because they offer a fleeting sense of reassurance in a deadly warzone.

## the rise of short-form content

This movement is not new. Influencers have dominated social media for god knows how long now. But when combined with the rise of short-form content, this effect exponentiates. We are witnessing the inception of: the _LinkedInfluencer_.

Increasingly, these digital personas contort their stories into neatly-packaged, one-sentence oxymorons - posts that promise to be profound but rarely make it past performative. The goal is no longer to connect, but to convert: attention into engagement, engagement into visibility. Authentic experiences are repackaged into hype-writing, designed less for relatability and more for applause. The raw edges of personal narrative are smoothed out, lacquered with buzzwords, and polished into optimized slogans.

Even worse is when the post does not even try to mask that it's going for visibility. But then there are just outrageous posts that combines a random hot take about dating, attached to slice-of-life images of themselves that has nothing to do with anything. What is even going on? Of course, I love my occasional LinkedIn Clash of Clans town hall update post, because at least it is still trying to take a stab at something, and at least tries to bring humor into a baren place. But, we have started writing for the reaction, not the reflection. We strip away the human messiness of growth and reduce it into punchy digestible bites.

There's also a strange irony here. As we all try to appear more successful, polished, and self-sufficient, we end up building walls that make connection - the overarching goal of Linkedin - harder. How do you ask for help when you're too busy signaling that you're already winning? How do you offer support when everyone else seems to already have it figured out? Connection, at its core, requires vulnerability. It means admitting you don’t know something. It means reaching out without an agenda. But the current atmosphere discourages that kind of openness. Instead, we’re coached to network with purpose. While strategic, it can sometimes sterilize what could have been an honest, even serendipitous conversation.

## let's bring it back

At the end of the day, LinkedIn was built on a real and meaningful need. It's hard to deny the value of a platform that helps people showcase their skills, share their milestones, and connect in a professional space. When used intentionally, it lowers the barrier to opportunity. It makes visibility, and by extension, access, more equitable.

But the temptation to overuse, to overoptimize, is real. And the moment it becomes an echo chamber that feeds into our ego rather than our growth, it stops serving us. Worse, it starts shaping us.

I believe we all feel the line between showing what we're capable of and shouting it through a megaphone. But it's a fine line. It shifts from person to person. Truthfully, I don’t even know where I draw it myself. Maybe none of us do, and that’s okay. What matters is that we’re thinking about it.

I still don’t believe this erosion is irreversible. There’s something quietly radical and beautiful about people who resist the performative pull, who respond to cold messages with kindness, who leave thoughtful comments instead of the rinse-and-repeat “Congrats!”, who treat LinkedIn not as a funnel, but as a room. A room where curiosity, generosity, and actual conversation are still possible.

Human connection doesn’t scale. Maybe it was never meant to.

But it doesn’t need to disappear. We just need to remember how to recognize it, and more importantly, how to make space for it.
