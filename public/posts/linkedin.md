title: LinkedIn and the death of human connection

description: Whatever happened to LinkedIn? Human connection doesn’t scale. Maybe it was never meant to.

As a disclaimer, I have nothing against LinkedIn as a platform. I personally think LinkedIn does its job very well: it serves as a platform for people to show off something cool they have done, a milestone in their professional development, maybe re-discovering that fleeting connection with a teammate at some hackathon. And that's great! In the information era, visibility is everything. Anecdotally or not, I have heard plenty of success stories of successful offers, meaningful connections that eventually turn into friendships, the whole nine yards. There’s no denying it: the platform works - but you don’t need me to tell you that.

What I’ve started to notice, though, is a quiet shift away from those original intentions. Instead of celebrating new feats or sharing something genuinely cool, more posts now feel like exercises in self-promotion. There are the one-liner hooks, to the likes of _“If you’re not jumping on the X train, you’re falling behind,”_ or _“How I got 30 offers by doing X as a Y”_. Then comes a cascade of short, punchy lines, designed for maximum retention. Then come the challenge-bait posts: thinly veiled asks framed as bravado: _"I have never failed at X. Prove me wrong if you can.”_

I get it. In this day and age where the crowd keeps getting bigger, standing out requires creativity. In some ways more than one, this is doing just that! But, with all of this, there is the big question that looms over: **what is all of this doing to our own sense of human**

## pressure: when humility takes a backseat

There are numerable different reasons why LinkedIn content has become what it currently is. To me, the three factors responsible for this shift are:

- the fragility of personal branding,
- the pressure of comparison,
- and the rise of short form content.

The saying goes back to the inception of the web: if something is put on the Internet, it stays there forever. For some casual social media websites such as Facebook or Instagram, this wouldn't pose much of an issue because of its relative low-pressure environments. However, when something as important as your career is on the line, the pressure of having to always maintain a facade of success suddenly manifests. We always need to have our show masks on, ready to rattle away at our achievements like the ABCs. On LinkedIn (and, admittedly, many other social media platforms), the world is perfect. Everyone excels at what they do, and the world keeps moving on. But the world isn't perfect - and that is exactly the point: We have reached this impasse where vulnerability is recognized as failure, and one single dent will destroy our personal brand forever. Everything needs to be curated to show off as much success as possible.

This effect cascades. As we see everyone else around us clearly demonstrating value, two harmful tendencies arise: jealousy or self-deprecation. This fuels a relentless cycle of social comparison, where we measure our worth against a digital highlight reel. We crave that external validation - the likes, the comments, the "Congrats!" notifications - because they offer a fleeting sense of reassurance in a competitive landscape. In doing that, we start to fear failure as something of an "end-all be-all", instead of embracing it an opportunity to learn something. Contentment and willingness to be vulnerable about challenges gets pushed aside in favor of a polished, unblemished narrative of achievement.

When combined with the movement to short-form content, this effect exponentiates. The "Attention is all you need" effect is more massive than ever before. Increasingly, "LinkedInfluencers" try to reform their content into digestible one-sentence oxymorons, designed for maximum sensational value. Authentic stories are re-packaged as captivating hype-writing to the general audience. Compliment fishing becomes harder and harder to tell. Meaningful content dissolves into repeated one-offs and cheap regurgitations of cliche "advice" as old as time. In this movement, **originality fades**, giving rise to a new generation where sheer volume and being on the algorithm's good side dominates.

## the performative nature of thought leadership

Somewhere along the lines, the idea of “thought leadership” on LinkedIn began to morph. Originally, it was about sharing real perspectives, lessons learned the hard way, or offering nuanced insight into a difficult problem. But in the era of optimized engagement and the never-ending race to remain “top of mind,” the act of sharing has often turned into a performance. A performance not of vulnerability, or reflection, or depth—but of competence, confidence, and convenience.

A lot of modern LinkedIn is content that all sounds the same. Hot takes wrapped in hashtags. Over-polished advice with no scars. Lists of “5 things I learned as X that no one talks about”, except we have all seen variations of them dozens of times. I don’t think people are being disingenuous on purpose; but when you’re rewarded for being loud and agreeable, rather than inquisitive or skeptical, the platform will naturally drift toward echo chambers. Posts that provoke honest questioning or admit ambiguity get quietly drowned out by those that fit the algorithm better.

If everyone else is positioning themselves as an expert (even when they’re still figuring things out), there is unspoken pressure to do the same: skip the part where you’re still confused, or the admission of "I don't know". Even the phrase “lifelong learner” has become a hollow tagline instead of a genuine ethos. What was once a mark of curiosity is now a branding slogan.

We start writing for the reaction, not the reflection. We strip away the human messiness of growth and reduce it into punchy digestible bites. But there’s a tradeoff: when everything becomes performative, the value of the actual insight erodes. It’s hard to tell who is genuinely exploring a thought, and who’s writing a post that just _sounds_ like insight.

## the erosion of genuine connection

This is a huge topic that arguably has everything to do with the internet as a whole. I think that there are a lot of parallels to growth patterns of the WWW and social media themselves. Back in the day, the internet was created as a means of connection, allowing people from all over the world to talk to one another in ways unimaginable. I was unfortunately not around for the inception, but was fortunate enought to have it be a part of my life in the early 2010s. Back then, the internet was all about expression. Everyone has their own "twists", we are unafraid of self-expression, and the biggest internet trend was personality. "Now playing" lists on MySpace, life photos posted on Facebook, even the silly now-retro site decorations - they give life to the persona behind the screen.

As the internet grows, a lot of those corners have died out. Now, social media is an numbers game. All the things that make up a personality becomes a statistic. 10k users, 500+ connections, it is almost disconcerting to see people being reduced to a mere number. Stats became the first thing we see, through which we unconsciously form judgement. Statements like "Oh, I can't be with a person who only has 80 followers!" become normalized. Sure, it can really help with detecting fake profiles or red flags, don't get me wrong, but it gets unhealthy as soon as we start chasing a metric instead of building a connection.

And the inverse is also true! People with a large following began demanding celebrity treatment, using their numbers as a leverage. LinkedIn is arguably little different, although to much less of an extent. Again, this is just anecdotes that I have personally heard, and I do not know the actual proportions of using-to-build-connections users versus the all-for-my-personal-benefit users. One particular story comes to mind. Person A, who has 10k+ followers on LinkedIn messages hundreds of people asking for a referral for jobs. They are persistent about it, regularly sending follow-up messages, reaching out for cafe chats, everything of the sort. When the answer comes back as a "no", person A did not even bother to the inbox, or reply with a thank you. To an outsider like me, this just feels rude and uncourteous. To the person on the other side, it feels like they are being treated as a tool.

Maybe that’s the crux of the issue. When people are seen as stepping stones instead of peers, conversations stop being conversations, **they become transactions**. Connection becomes conditional, and trust, something that used to be built slowly and sincerely, is now forced to happen in the span of a cold DM.

This isn't to say that everyone who reaches out is doing it with bad intentions. I’ve met some incredible people on LinkedIn through a simple message. But there’s a difference between wanting to get to know someone, versus wanting something from them. And often, you can feel it right away. The copy-pasted message, the vague compliment followed by an immediate ask, the absence of context or curiosity - it feels that we have become so focused on optimizing our outreach that **we forget to be human.**

There's also a strange irony here. As we all try to appear more successful, polished, and self-sufficient, we end up building walls that make genuine connection harder. How do you ask for help when you're too busy signaling that you're already winning? How do you offer support when everyone else seems to already have it figured out? Connection, at its core, requires vulnerability. It means admitting you don’t know something. It means reaching out without an agenda. But the current atmosphere discourages that kind of openness. Instead, we’re coached to network with purpose. While strategic, it can sometimes sterilize what could have been an honest, even serendipitous conversation.

## let's bring it back

At the end of the day, LinkedIn was built on a real and meaningful need. It's hard to deny the value of a platform that helps people showcase their skills, share their milestones, and connect in a professional space. When used intentionally, it lowers the barrier to opportunity. It makes visibility, and by extension, access, more equitable.

But the temptation to overuse, to overoptimize, is real. And the moment it becomes an echo chamber that feeds into our ego rather than our growth, it stops serving us. Worse, it starts shaping us.

I believe we all feel the line between showing what we're capable of and shouting it through a megaphone. But it's a fine line. It shifts from person to person. Truthfully, I don’t even know where I draw it myself. Maybe none of us do, and that’s okay. What matters is that we’re thinking about it.

I still don’t believe this erosion is irreversible. There’s something quietly radical and beautiful about people who resist the performative pull, who respond to cold messages with kindness, who leave thoughtful comments instead of the rinse-and-repeat “Congrats!”, who treat LinkedIn not as a funnel, but as a room. A room where curiosity, generosity, and actual conversation are still possible.

Human connection doesn’t scale. Maybe it was never meant to.

But it doesn’t need to disappear. We just need to remember how to recognize it, and more importantly, how to make space for it.
